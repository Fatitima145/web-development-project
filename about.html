<h2>Biography</h2> <!--contains the 3 different sections broken down-->

    <h4>Background:</h4> <!--background section-->
    <div class="boxtext-facts">I was born in Canada and my family moved around a lot when I was younger. After 8 years living in Canada, we moved to Pakistan and lived there for 2 years. Eventually, we moved to the US and I have lived here in Georgia ever since. I have made a lot of different types of friends because we moved around a lot. I have a lot of experience with knowing how to talk to people because of that and it's something that has made me more extroverted. 
</div> <!--all the different sections have div class "boxtext" because I wanted them to be in the boxes-->

    <h4>Experiences:</h4> <!--experience section-->
    <div class="boxtext-facts">I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to jobs because I haven't had one yet. I plan to work during the summer to gain some experience. So far the only experience I have with jobs was babysitting. I have done a couple of fundraisers and I always sold many products. I have also done some volunteer work at school and I enjoy learning new things. 
</div>

    <h4>Goals:</h4>
    <div class="boxtext-facts">One of my goals for the future is to get a good job and gain some experience in the working field. I also want to graduate from university with good grades and on time. My long-term goals are to graduate college and get a well-paying job that I enjoy. My short-term goals are to hopefully finish this semester off with all A's and get insurance so I can drive. I also want to stay healthy and not get sick.
