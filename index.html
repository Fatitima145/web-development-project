 <h2>General Information About Me</h2>

 <div class="boxtext-facts">Hello Everybody! My name is Fatima Ahmed and this is the home page of my portfolio. One thing you should know about me is that I am currently a junior at Kennesaw State University. I'm majoring in IT but used to major in Computer Science. I've enjoyed my experience at KSU so far and I can't wait to graduate.
</div>  <!--I want this part to be in a box so I made the div class for the CSS-->

<h3>Other Facts:</h3> <!--want this to be in a smaller bold font so it's h3-->

<p>This is only the second website I have ever created and the first website I ever made was actually in my freshman year of university. I would like to get better at this skill because I do find it to be fun. I hope you enjoy learning about me through this portfolio. Feel free to click the "About" tab to learn more about me!</p>
